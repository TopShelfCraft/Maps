<h2>Quickstart</h2>

<p>Taking your first payment with Charge is as simple as 3 steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#step1">Set your Stripe API Keys</a></li>
	<li><a href="#step2">Add the Payment Form</a></li>
	<li><a href="#step3">Add the Form Javascript</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="step1">1. Set your Stripe API Keys</h3>

<p>Stripe has 2 modes you can run in, <strong>Live</strong> and <strong>Test</strong>. Each of the modes has a set of 2 unique keys, called your <strong>Publishable Key</strong> and <strong>Secret Key</strong>. In the Charge settings you'll see places to input all of those codes, as well as a toggle to change the stripe mode. </p>

<p>Your API keys are listed in the Stripe control panel, found under [Your Account] > [API Keys].</p>

<h3 id="step2">2. Add the Payment Form</h3>

<p>The payment form is the main part of setting up Charge on your site. This form has a few simple required fields, and a few optional ones which you can use to customize the payments and customer information collected. At it's most <em>simplest</em> we need fields for the user's <em>Card</em>, and a value to take for the payment. </p>

<p>Set up a standard html form, and simply add a few required fields. <a href="/plugins/charge/docs/payment-form">See what fields you'll need for the payment form.</a></p>

<h3 id="step3">3. Add the Form Javascript</h3>

<p>To take simple card payments, Stripe uses javascript to intercept the form action and create a secure token of the payment card details.</p>

<p>You'll need to include the Stripe javascript library on the payment pages like so : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="<em>{{ resourceUrl('charge/js/stripe_v2.min.js') }}</em>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>And our javascript to take over the form : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="<em>{{ resourceUrl('charge/js/jquery.charge.js') }}</em>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>And finally, our publishable key, and specific setup values : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
(function(window, undefined) {
        Stripe.setPublishableKey('<em>{{ craft.charge.getPublicKey() }}</em>');
        $(this).<em>charge('#charge-form', '#payment-errors', '#progress-indicator')</em>;
})(window);
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>This is the simplest javascript setup, but of course you're able to extend or setup your own usage however you'd like.</p>
