<h4 id="q-autoupdate">Can Charge auto-update?</h4>
<p>Plugin auto-updates are going to be integrated into Craft when the third party plugin store is released. Until then, you'll have to manually update Charge.</p>

<h4 id="q-licenses">Will I be able to transfer licenses later to the built in plugin store?</h4>
<p>Of course. When the Craft releases the integrated third party plugin store, we'll be transferring all existing purchases over. We'll contact everyone to confirm details before then. We're expecting the plugin store to be released in Spring 2014</p>


<h4 id="q-support">How can I get support?</h4>
<p>Just send an email to <a href="mailto:support@squarebit.co.uk">support@squarebit.co.uk</a> and we'll help you out.</p>

<h4 id="q-ee">Can I use Charge on ExpressionEngine?</h4>
<p>Absolutely. <a href="/addons/charge">Charge</a> is also available on EE. It's not a 1:1 port, but the core features are the same. Be aware of the differences in variable naming, as charge follows the platform convention in both versions. </p>
<p>So, in Charge for Craft the variable for customer name is : '<em>customerName</em>', in Charge for ExpressionEngine, the variable is : '<em>customer_name</em>'. etc..</p>

<p>If you can't see an example of your needed usage in the documentation, just drop a line to <a href="mailto:support@squarebit.co.uk">support@squarebit.co.uk</a> and I'll help you out. Feature requests are always welcome too.</p>
