<p>Original ExpressionEngine development of Charge was made possible by the support of <a href="http://dandelion-burdock.com/">Niall Thompson of Dandelion &amp; Burdock</a>. They're using Charge for a simple single-page product site called <a href="http://into-orbit.co.uk/">Into Orbit</a> designed to be the quickest way to setup a single property site for homeowners looking to sell.</p>
